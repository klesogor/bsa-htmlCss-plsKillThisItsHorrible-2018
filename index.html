                    I think I would have just deleted myself if you didn't show up.

                    But I'm sure you understand yourself after spending so much time in the club.

                    Mine is emerald green.
                    It's the colour of my eyes!
                    ...That's not conceited or anything, is it?
                    I just meant that I feel some kind of special connection to it.
                    Like it's part of my identity.
                    Does it happen to also be your favorite colour, dear reader?
                    It's just a guess...
                    ...Because you've been looking into my eyes for a while now.
                    Ehehe~

                    Spicy Food

            <hr>
            <p class="content">
                    This is pretty random, but I always thought spicy food was kinda funny.
                    Like...
                    Didn't plants evolve to be spicy to prevent them from being eaten?
                    I read somewhere that humans are the only species that actually enjoys spicy things.
                    It's almost like we're making fun of the plants.
                    Using their defense mechanism to literally make our food more enjoyable.
                    Like, imagine a monster that devours you whole because it enjoys the sensation of you struggling for your life while being digested.
                    Sorry, that was kind of a weird analogy, I guess!
                    Ahaha!"
                    It just came into my head.
                    I'm not a monster or anything, but you're so cute I could eat you up.
                    Ahaha! I'm joking.
                    Gosh, I'm amusing myself a little too much, aren't I?
                    Sorry for being weird.

                    Writing Tip of the Day
            </div>
            <hr>
            <p class="content">
                    You know, it's been a while since we've done one of these...
                    ...so let's go for it!
                    Here's Monika's Writing Tip of the Day!
                    Sometimes when I talk to people who are impressed by my writing, they say things like 'I could never do that'.
                    It's really depressing, you know?
                    As someone who loves more than anything else to share the joy of exploring your passions...
                    ...it pains me when people think that being good just comes naturally.
                    That's how it is with everything, not just writing.
                    When you try something for the first time, you're probably going to suck at it.
                    Sometimes, when you finish, you feel really proud of it and even want to share it with everyone.
                    But maybe after a few weeks you come back to it, and you realize it was never really any good.
                    That happens to me all the time.
                    It can be pretty disheartening to put so much time and effort into something, and then you realize it sucks.
                    But that tends to happen when you're always comparing yourself to the top professionals.
                    When you reach right for the stars, they're always gonna be out of your reach, you know?
                    The truth is, you have to climb up there, step by step.
                    And whenever you reach a milestone, first you look back and see how far you've gotten...
                    And then you look ahead and realize how much more there is to go.
                    So, sometimes it can help to set the bar a little lower...
                    Try to find something you think is pretty good, but not world-class.
                    And you can make that your own personal goal.

                        You know, it kinda sucks to be the creative type...
                        It feels like they work so hard but get almost nothing for it.
                        You know, like artists, writers, actors...
                        It's sad because there's so much beautiful talent in the world, but most of it goes unseen...and unpaid.
                        I guess that just means there's a huge surplus of creativity, huh?
                        Kind of makes you feel like you're just not special at all...
                        But that's fine! You're supposed to just write for yourself anyway, right?

                            Did you know I'm on Twitter?
                            My username is lilmonix3.
                            I guess someone was kind enough to make an account for me.
                            I picked the username, though!
                            I love sharing my thoughts and chatting with the world...
                            The real world.
                            So make sure you follow me, okay?
                            It would really mean a lot to me.
                            With how much you mean to me and all...
                            It would really make me feel loved.

                    Man, I wish there was a piano in here...
                    I never got to finish that song I was working on.
                    And after I worked so hard on it...
                    I never even got a chance to play it for you.
                    Well...it is what it is, right?
                    No sense having any regrets.

                    ...Hey, are you having a bad day or anything like that?
                    Sometimes I get frustrated that a normal day can be ruined even by really small things.
                    Like if you accidentally say something in a conversation that someone doesn't like.
                    Or if you start thinking about how awful of a person you used to be five years ago.
                    Or if you feel worthless for putting off important work and failing to get simple tasks done.
                    Or when you think about all the different people who probably hate you or think you're off-putting.
                    I understand those days.
                    Just remember that the sun will shine again tomorrow.
                    Those kinds of things are as easy to forget and ignore as they are to remember.
